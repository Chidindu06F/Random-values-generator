This plugin is created to help you save time and speed up productivity by allowing you generate random values with just a click.

You can quickly create numeric, alphanumeric, or pattern-based random values.

Whether you’re prototyping, testing input fields, or designing layouts, this plugin ensures precision and speed by generating values tailored to your needs.

How to use

1. Run the Random Values generator plugin
2. Select one or multiple text layers
3. Select the type of values you want, enter your preferred number of character and click on ‘Generate values”
4. The pattern-based values allow you to define the format in which random values are generated. For example, by using "X" for random alphabets and "#" for random numbers, you can control the structure of the output. Separators such as - (dash), . (dot), and \_ (underscore) can also be included to customize the format further.
   Example Patterns:

X#XX## could generate D3FR53.

##XX#X-XX## could generate 06CO2M-FC92.

This feature allows you to create structured, randomized values for placeholders, tokens, or testing data with ease.

Use cases:

1. Populating Placeholder Data : Use the plugin to generate realistic placeholder values for prototypes, such as: Unique identifiers (e.g., serial numbers, order numbers, or product codes).
2. Form fields like usernames, passwords, or verification codes
3. Generate unique codes and simulate real world data: Generate pattern-based values to mimic specific real-world data, such as: License plates, invoice numbers, customer IDs, coupons, gift card, events tickets
4. Testing UI scalability: Check how your designs handle varying lengths and types of values, ensuring components like input fields, labels, and tables remain responsive and visually consistent.
